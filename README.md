# Google Apps Script for File Management and Organization in Google Drive

This project contains a set of Google Apps Script functions designed to help manage and organize files within Google Drive. The main features of this script include:

- **File Listing**: Generates a Google Sheet that lists all files within a specified folder, including subfolders, along with details like file size (in MB), file type, creation date, and media playtime (for audio/video files).
- **File Organization**: Moves files into designated folders within Google Drive based on keywords in their file names, allowing for quick and efficient file sorting.
- **Empty Folder Cleanup**: Recursively checks for and deletes empty folders within a specified directory, keeping your Drive clean and organized.

## How to Use

1. **Set Up**: Open Google Apps Script, paste the code from this repository, and replace placeholders (like folder IDs) as needed.
2. **Run the Script**: Use the functions to list files in a new Google Sheet, sort files based on specific keywords, or clean up empty folders in your Drive.
3. **Customize**: Modify the script to fit specific file management needs or integrate additional Drive features.

This repository serves as an educational resource for file automation using Google Apps Script. Contributions and suggestions for improvement are welcome!
